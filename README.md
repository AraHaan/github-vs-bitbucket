### Github vs. BitBucket

Welcome github users. You might be Wondering *Why would I want to use github over bitbucket?* or *Why would I want to use bitbucket over github?*

The answer is a bit farther down.

## Github

1. Github has really awesome markdown support.

2. Github is free for public repositories. Bitbucket is as well.

3. Github has an really nice issue tracker. It can even be disabled but hides all issues. (be nice if there was an option to just disable the "New Issue" and the "New Pull Request options" instead when you want to make an github repository readonly, that is all current issues readable but people cannot comment on them nor create new issues / pull requests without blocking anyone)

4. All repositories can use ``Projects`` for grouping changesets together.

5. Wiki's for every projects.

6. The pulse on repos to know how frequently someone commits on repositories.

7. Supports all different types of documentation formats. (supports RST and other formats that are not Markdown)

8. Any private Repositories must be paid for with $$$.

## BitBucket

1. Awesome Markdown support but lacks the ``- [ ]``'s making it impossible for creating checkboxes in markdown (useful for checking off when problems are fixed in issues step by step).

2. Free and unlimited private repositories on BitBucket (But every private repository has a max of about 10 mebers or so making it you have to pay $$$ to have more than 10 or so I think).

3. A Nice Issue Tracker and pull requests.

4. Able to export and import issues (Github does not have this at all making github inflexible if you want to sync all issues to bitbucket as well).

5. Supports all different types of documentation formats. (supports RST and other formats that are not Markdown)

6. It is easier to just support an easily managed public bugtracker for closed sourced projects. (Github does not allow this for private repositories.

7. Wikis for every projects. (Optional)

### Resolution

Github has a lot of awesome features. But ButBucket has a little more than Github as well and it provides free private repositories for open sourced projects. If companies like Microsoft was to know about that they would definately move to bitbucket to favor it which could mean less $$$ for 
Github. Who knows what if BitBucket also implemented everything github has? 
What would mean then everyone would want to move to BitBucket which would mean Github would probably have to shut down 
because of BitBucket taking all of their users and source of income.
